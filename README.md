## Project Overview 

- The aim of this practice is to refine key concepts of data analysis such as: Analysing Business Requests, Transforming Data, Cleaning Data, Using Business Logic to bring Value, Storytelling, Dashboard Design, among others.

### Case Study
You are a payroll analyst working for Gran Empresa de TI, SA de CV, a global technology company with a presence around the world. You specialize exclusively in the payroll for Mexico.

Currently, salary increases for next year are being analyzed, and there are two differing opinions on how they should be applied.

The local managers in Mexico want to create an egalitarian plan, assigning equal raises to all employees because that’s the way it has always been done. The Vice Presidents in the United States, however, have been studying the raise practices of a competitor, MacroHard INC, where low-performing employees are terminated and high-performing employees receive higher raises.

The main reason why low-performing employees are not terminated in the Mexican division of Gran Empresa de TI is that Mexican Labor Law requires very costly severance payments for dismissed employees. For this reason, managers prefer to keep a low-level employee rather than justify the massive severance payment.

The company evaluates employees on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the rating for the worst employees and 5 being the highest rating. The American plan involves firing all employees with a rating of 1 and giving double the proposed raise to employees rated 4 and 5. The Mexican plan involves not firing anyone and giving the same raise to everyone.

Your task is to provide the numbers for the decision by calculating the costs of both scenarios and presenting them in a dashboard format.

## Deliverables

Create a dashboard that shows the following:
  - Total current payroll expense (all components)
  - Cost of implementing the American plan, in dollars and percentage
  - Cost of implementing the Mexican plan, in dollars and percentage
  - Chart of current costs by performance rating
  - Table of current costs by department, in dollars and percentage
  - Two additional slicers (by grade and by department)

Your report should incorporate all the necessary data so that managers have a clear picture of the situation. You should clean the data if necessary. The report must be dynamic and include new data as it becomes available.

There is no single correct answer. You will be evaluated based on how versatile your file is, the quality of your analysis, and the clarity of your presentation.
